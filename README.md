GagBook
=======

GagBook is a [9GAG](http://9gag.com) app for MeeGo Harmattan and Symbian^3, written using Qt/QML.
GagBook is not an official app of 9GAG.

GagBook get data from 9GAG by scraping their website, or using [InfiniGAG](https://github.com/k3min/infinigag)
API. This might be unethical but I made this app because there is no official 9GAG app for MeeGo Harmattan
and Symbian^3.

Please note that I get **NO PROFIT** by making this app.
